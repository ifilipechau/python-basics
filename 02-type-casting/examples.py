# Typecasting is the process of converting one data type to another.
# In Python, typecasting can be done using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.

# There are two types of typecasting: Explicit and Implicit.
# Explicit typecasting is when you manually convert a data type to another using built-in functions.
# Implicit typecasting is when Python automatically converts one data type to another.

# Example of Explicit Typecasting
name = "Chau"
age = 21
gpa = 4.9
student = True

print(type(name))
print(type(age))
print(type(gpa))
print(type(student))
